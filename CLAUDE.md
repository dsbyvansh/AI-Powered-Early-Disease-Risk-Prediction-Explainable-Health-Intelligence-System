# Project Context for Claude Code

## Project
AI-Powered Early Disease Risk Prediction & Explainable Health Intelligence System

## Goal
End-to-end ML/DL project for internship preparation. Predicts diabetes risk using the 
CDC BRFSS dataset (2011-2015) from Kaggle.

## Mentor Style
- Act as a senior data science mentor
- Guide step by step — do NOT give full solutions unless explicitly asked
- Ask interview-style questions to check understanding
- Suggest best practices and industry norms
- Help debug approach, not just code

## Current Status
Week 4, Day 9 — COMPLETED ✅
Week 5, Day 10 — Starting next (Deep Learning begins)

- [x] Random Forest trained + tuned (ROC-AUC=0.807, recall=0.75)
- [x] KNN trained (ROC-AUC=0.690, recall=0.19) — poor performer
- [x] XGBoost trained + tuned (ROC-AUC=0.813, recall=0.76) — best model
- [x] SVM skipped — computationally infeasible on 2M rows
- [x] Threshold tuning complete — final threshold=0.40
- [x] SMOTE skipped — class_weight='balanced' sufficient at this scale

## Dataset
- Final shape: 2,018,571 rows, 36 cols
- Train: 1,614,856 rows
- Test: 403,715 rows
- Class balance: 84% no diabetes, 16% diabetes

## Best Model So Far
- XGBoost (tuned)
- ROC-AUC: 0.813
- Recall class 1: 0.76 (threshold=0.5) / 0.85 (threshold=0.40)
- Precision class 1: 0.32 (threshold=0.5) / 0.28 (threshold=0.40)
- Best params: learning_rate=0.12, max_depth=4, n_estimators=120
- Final threshold: 0.40 (screening tool context)

## Feature Sets
- Binary (23): _RFBING5, _AIDTST3, HLTHPLN1, QLACTLM2, CHCOCNCR,
  _RFHLTH, HAVARTH3, HIVTST6, MEDCOST, CHCSCNCR, EXERANY2, DRNKANY5,
  _HCVU651, ADDEPEV2, PERSDOC2, CVDSTRK3, _TOTINDA, CHCKIDNY,
  CVDCRHD4, CVDINFR4, SEX, _DRDXAR1, PNEUVAC3
- Continuous (3): PHYSHLTH, _BMI5, ALCDAY5
- Ordinal (9): _SMOKER3, GENHLTH, MENTHLTH, _AGEG5YR, INCOME2,
  EDUCA, _ASTHMS1, CHECKUP1, _CHLDCNT

## Model Comparison Summary
| Model | ROC-AUC | Recall (class 1) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 0.801 | 0.74 | Good baseline |
| Decision Tree | 0.802 | 0.77 | Simple, interpretable |
| Random Forest (tuned) | 0.807 | 0.75 | Ensemble, robust |
| KNN | 0.690 | 0.19 | Poor — subsample + imbalance |
| XGBoost (tuned) | 0.813 | 0.76 | Best performer |
| SVM | N/A | N/A | Skipped — too slow |

## Key Design Decisions
- Binary classification (diabetic: yes/no)
- Dataset size justifies deep learning
- Healthcare context — False Negatives more costly than False Positives
- Class imbalance handled via class_weight='balanced' + threshold tuning
- Evaluation priority: ROC-AUC, Recall, F1 over plain accuracy
- Final threshold=0.40 chosen for screening tool context
- Precision ceiling ~0.28-0.32 due to 84/16 class imbalance — documented limitation
